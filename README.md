# Text summarization
In this project, I build my own text summarization app from scratch, using HuggingFace API. This project is designed as an end-to-end project, allowing me to practice the whole process of machine learning development, which includes setting up the environments, model development, deploying the model on cloud, and maintaining the model using CI/CD framework. 

This project generally follows the guideline provided by 'DSwithBappy' in his [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/p7V4Aa7qEpw?list=PLDcfxd4ep_-5N_B-SRYvrqrLD-Dd8WxUC), with some tweaks made by myself to make the app meet my needs.
